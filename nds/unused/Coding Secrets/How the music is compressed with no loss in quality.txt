In the DS(i) version of Super Photo Studio, some work was done to keep the music file size down while retaining the high quality.

Any reused or duplicated parts of the music are deleted, and the part that would be reused is put into a single file.
The parts would then be played in a sequence, for example:

Super Mario Bros.: Overworld Theme
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 5, 0, and so on...

Depending on if:
* The music is stereo or mono
* The Hz is high or low
* How many reused parts of the music there is
You could save a huge amount of ROM space for more content, rather than using a single music stream file to take a lot of space.
For example, the music above is normally around 4 MB, but after opimzation, it's 1.20 MB.
