For Style Savvy's 10th Anniversary, a new save editor is here!

# Features

* Edit save data from all four Style Savvy games.
* As of currently, only games 2-4 are supported, and KOR region is not supported.
* The GUI from Kirakira Code/Fashion Forward (third game).
* Pre-rendered characters and backgrounds.
* Sound effects from ChuChu Rocket.
* Play as most characters from all Style Savvy games, in all (except first) Style Savvy games!     (Shop customers and brand reps not included.)
* When importing a character from those games, you can press L or R to select the seasonal outfit.     (Note that not all characters will have seasonal outfits.)
* Add characters from the first game, Trendsetters, and Styling Star, as extra contacts in Fashion Forward!
* You can also export your current character, in case if you want to restore/import it later.
* (SS3/SS4) Import/Export brand emblems for custom designed outfits.
* Apply music packs to Style Savvy: Trendsetters. (Requires game patching enabled in Luma.)
* Coming soon: Change attributes of your character (such as gender, skin color, pose set, height, etc.).
* Coming soon (SS4): Change bow placement on your character, if a bow is being worn.

Before using Savvy Manager, it is recommended back up your Style Savvy game save(s) using Checkpoint, in case something goes wrong.

**WARNING**     
Star Stylist/Styling Star players, if you're playing as a male character, or as a female character with a unique eye shape (ex. Ang√©lique), it is highly recommended you don't update your shop data at Shopdo.
As such features are not normally available in-game, you may risk a possible ban when doing so, as the character data will be part of your Shopdo.
