What happens when you take the concept of *Super Smash Bros.*, and turn it from a fighting game, into a photo shoot application?     
The result, *Super Photo Studio*! Take pictures of your favorite all-star characters, in any location possible!

*Super Photo Studio* has it all: An all-star cast, famous outdoor and indoor locations, stylish girls, the coolest of TWL himself, and fan-favorites like Waluigi!

# What is this?

*Super Photo Studio* is basically an upgraded version of the *Style Savvy* series's photo studio feature, with added characters and locations outside of said series. You can also change the character's expressions and poses, though *Super Photo Studio* does not support changing those, as it would be time-consuming, as well as taking up more space.
