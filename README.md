For Style Savvy's 10th Anniversary, a new save editor is here!

**Features**

* Edit save data from all four Style Savvy games.
* As of currently, only USA region games and 2-4 are supported.
* The GUI from Kirakira Code/Fashion Forward (third game).
* Sound effects from ChuChu Rocket.
* Play as most characters from all Style Savvy games, in all (except first) Style Savvy games!     (Shop customers and brand reps not included.)
* When importing a character from those games, you can press L or R to select the seasonal outfit.     (Note that not all characters will have seasonal outfits.)
* You can also export your current character, in case if you want to restore/import it later.
* Coming soon (SS3/SS4): Import/Export brand emblems for custom designed outfits.
* Coming soon: Change attributes of your character (such as gender, skin color, pose set, height, etc.).
* Coming soon (SS4): Change bow placement on your character, if a bow is being worn.

Before using Savvy Manager, back up your Style Savvy game save(s) using Checkpoint, and call the backup (without quotes) "SavvyManager".
After modifying the save using Savvy Manager, restore the "SavvyManager" backup using Checkpoint.

If you recently saved in your game after making the backup, please back up the game save again, as (without quotes) "SavvyManager", if you want to use this tool again.

**WARNING**     
Styling Star players, if you're playing as a male character, or as a female character with a unique eye shape (ex. Ang√©lique), it is highly recommended you don't update your shop data at Shopdo.
As such features are not normally available in-game, you may risk a possible ban when doing so, as the character data will be part of your Shopdo.
